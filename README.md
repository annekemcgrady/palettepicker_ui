# Welcome to ColourRad

## Description

ColourRad is an application that allows a user to generate random colors, save them as a palette and assign them to a project. Upon generating the random colors, the user can "lock" any hues they like and continue generating at random until they have a full palette that they'd like to save. Great for gaining ideas for decorating a room, choosing an outfit or making art.
